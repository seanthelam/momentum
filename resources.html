        <!-- What is an REU? -->
        <section id="what-is-reu" class="guide-content">
            <h2>What is an REU?</h2>
            <p>REU stands for Research Experience for Undergraduates. These are summer programs funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that give undergraduate students hands-on research experience at universities and research institutions across the country.</p>
            
            <h3>What to Expect</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Typically 8-10 weeks during summer</li>
                <li><strong>Stipend:</strong> Usually $5,000-$7,000 plus housing and sometimes travel support</li>
                <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Work on a real research project with a faculty mentor</li>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> Meet other undergraduate researchers from across the country</li>
                <li><strong>Professional development:</strong> Workshops on graduate school, careers, scientific writing</li>
                <li><strong>Final presentation:</strong> Present your research findings at end of program</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Participate?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore whether you enjoy research and want to pursue graduate school</li>
                <li>Build your CV with research experience (essential for grad school applications)</li>
                <li>Get a strong letter of recommendation from a research mentor</li>
                <li>Learn new experimental or computational skills</li>
                <li>Experience life at a different university or research lab</li>
                <li>Network with faculty, grad students, and peers in your field</li>
                <li>Earn money while gaining valuable experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who Should Apply?</h3>
            <p>REUs are open to all undergraduate students, though most participants are sophomores and juniors. You don't need extensive research experience—many programs specifically welcome first-time researchers. You should apply if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You're curious about a subfield of physics</li>
                <li>You're considering graduate school (or want to explore if it's right for you)</li>
                <li>You want hands-on experience beyond classroom learning</li>
                <li>You're a sophomore or junior with at least Modern Physics completed</li>
                <li>You're eager to learn new skills and work on challenging problems</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Personal Statement Guide -->
        <section id="personal-statement" class="guide-content">
            <h2>Writing a Strong Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>Your personal statement is your chance to show programs who you are, what drives your interest in physics, and why you're a great fit for their REU. Here's how to craft a compelling statement.</p>

            <h3>What Programs Want to See</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genuine enthusiasm</strong> for the research area</li>
                <li><strong>Specific knowledge</strong> about the program and why it fits your interests</li>
                <li><strong>Relevant experience</strong> (coursework, projects, research)</li>
                <li><strong>Intellectual curiosity</strong> and ability to think critically</li>
                <li><strong>Clear goals</strong> for what you hope to learn</li>
                <li><strong>Strong writing skills</strong> and attention to detail</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Structure (Aim for ~500-750 words)</h3>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Paragraph 1: Opening Hook (3-4 sentences)</h4>
                <p>Start with a compelling moment that sparked your interest in physics or the specific research area. This should be specific and personal—not generic.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "During my Modern Physics course, I became fascinated by quantum entanglement when we discussed the EPR paradox. The idea that particles could be instantaneously correlated across vast distances defied my classical intuition and motivated me to explore quantum information theory further."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Paragraph 2: Your Background (4-6 sentences)</h4>
                <p>Discuss relevant coursework, skills, and any prior research or projects. Connect these experiences to the REU program's focus.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I've completed coursework in Quantum Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory, and developed strong computational skills through my Computational Physics class. Last semester, I worked with Professor Smith on modeling quantum systems using Python, which strengthened my programming abilities and introduced me to numerical methods in quantum mechanics."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Paragraph 3: Why This Program? (4-6 sentences)</h4>
                <p>Show you've researched the program. Mention specific faculty, projects, or facilities that interest you. Be specific!</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to work with Professor Johnson on quantum computing implementations. Her recent paper on superconducting qubits aligns perfectly with my interest in experimental quantum information. Additionally, your program's emphasis on collaborative research and professional development workshops would help me develop both technical and communication skills."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Paragraph 4: Your Goals & Closing (3-4 sentences)</h4>
                <p>Explain what you hope to gain from the experience and how it fits into your broader goals.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Through this REU, I hope to gain hands-on experience with quantum hardware and determine whether experimental or theoretical research better suits my interests. I'm considering graduate school in physics, and this program would provide invaluable exposure to cutting-edge research while helping me refine my career goals."</p>

        <!-- Recommendation Letters -->
        <section id="rec-letters" class="guide-content">
            <h2>Requesting Letters of Recommendation</h2>
            <p>Strong letters of recommendation are crucial for REU and graduate school applications. Here's how to ask for them effectively and give your recommenders what they need to write strong letters.</p>

            <h3>Who to Ask</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professors who know you well:</strong> From classes where you excelled, participated actively, or did a project</li>
                <li><strong>Research mentors:</strong> Faculty you've done research with (these are ideal)</li>
                <li><strong>Lab instructors:</strong> If you've done well in lab courses and interacted significantly</li>
                <li><strong>NOT:</strong> TAs, graduate students, or professors you've never spoken to</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Ask</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>At least 3-4 weeks before the deadline</strong> (more time is even better)</li>
                <li>Earlier in the semester is better than during finals</li>
                <li>Give extra time if they need to write multiple letters</li>
                <li>Account for breaks and holidays</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Ask (In Person First!)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ask in person or via video call if possible:</strong> "Would you be willing to write me a strong letter of recommendation for REU programs?"</li>
                <li><strong>Give them an out:</strong> "I understand if you're too busy or don't feel you know my work well enough."</li>
                <li><strong>If they agree:</strong> Follow up with an email containing all materials (see below)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What to Provide Your Recommender</h3>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Email Template After Getting Agreement</h4>
